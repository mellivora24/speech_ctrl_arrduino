# Control-Arduino-using-Python
One fine day, an idea flashed through my mind about smart homes. With the knowledge I have about Arduino and Python I have written a program to control the Arduino physical board using voice.
Regarding the Python code I used libraries like (speech_recognition, os, gtts, pyserial).
This is a fun little project, I will improve it to look like "Smart Home".
Thank you for your interest!
